  Where’s My School Bus works on most web browsers, but not on all.  If you feel it is not formatting properly for you, please email the name of the web browser you are using to <a href="mailto:schoolbus@bostonpublicschools.org">schoolbus@bostonpublicschools.org</a>. 

  In the short term, you can try using a different web browser, such as Chrome, Internet Explorer 9, Firefox or Safari.  In the long term, we will explore adjusting the app to work on more browsers.

  Bus appearing in the Atlantic Ocean?
  </dt>
  <dd>
  If the GPS device on a bus is not working, it may show the bus is someplace that it is cer This  not.  For example, a bus may appear in the Atlantic Ocean off of the west coast of Africa. (For those interested, it appears there because that is zero latitude and zero longitude, which is the default location provided when there is not a GPS signal.) 

  If this happens to you, please email the bus number to <a href="mailto:schoolbus@bostonpublicschools.org">schoolbus@bostonpublicschools.org</a>. BPS will work with the bus company to make this fix.
